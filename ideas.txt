please change the symbol algorithm so that you have to put a symbol and both symbols cant be the same

let the user choose if they want to play with the hard/easy computer

keep track of the game score so that when the game is played again, we can see the score.(might want to make it best out of x rounds)

allow players to compete against each other

make the board larger(for eg 5*5)
