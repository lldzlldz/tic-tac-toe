1)fixed bugs
    -under the function hard_computers_turn
        changed game to temp_dict as it iterated over to 'human'(also makes code faster)
        changed the variable 'i' to 'j' as it conflicted with the earlier variable 'i' in the function
    -under the humans_turn function 
        there are different messages that pop out if you input the numbers wrongly
        the game will not end if you input the string ''
2)implemented a new main programme which uses less code 
3)Does not ask the human for their name
